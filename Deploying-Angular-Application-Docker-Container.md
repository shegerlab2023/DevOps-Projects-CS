# Deploying Angular Application in Docker Container

## Project Overview
In this project, we will walk through the process of deploying an Angular application within a Docker container. We will cover both development and production scenarios using the Angular CLI and Docker Compose to ensure a seamless deployment workflow.

## Project Steps

### 1. Angular Application Setup
- Create or use an existing Angular application.
- Ensure that you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed.

### 2. Dockerizing the Development Environment
- Set up a Dockerfile for the Angular application's development environment.
- Configure the Dockerfile to install Node.js and dependencies.
- Use Docker Compose to manage the development environment.
- Define development-related configurations (e.g., volume mounting for code changes).

### 3. Dockerizing the Production Environment
- Create a separate Dockerfile optimized for the production environment.
- Build the Angular application using the Angular CLI within the Docker container.
- Serve the production build using a lightweight server (e.g., NGINX) within the Docker container.

### 4. Docker Compose Configuration
- Define a Docker Compose file that manages both development and production setups.
- Set up services for the development environment (e.g., Angular app, development server).
- Configure services for the production environment (e.g., Angular app, NGINX server).

### 5. Development and Testing
- Run the Angular application in the development environment using Docker Compose.
- Verify that code changes are reflected in real-time with the help of volume mounting.

### 6. Production Deployment
- Build and deploy the Angular application in a production-ready Docker container.
- Test the production deployment locally using Docker Compose.

### 7. Documentation
- Document the steps followed for development and production Dockerization.
- Provide instructions for others to use and contribute to the project.

## Project Outcome
Upon completing this project, you will have gained practical experience in deploying an Angular application within Docker containers for both development and production environments. This knowledge will equip you with valuable skills for streamlining deployment workflows using containerization.

**Note:**
This project is customizable based on your Angular application's specific requirements. Ensure that you adhere to best practices and consider security considerations while deploying in a production environment.
